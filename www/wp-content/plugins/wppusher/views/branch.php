<h2>Announcing Branch - CI/CD for WordPress</h2>

<p>
    <strong>In late 2018, I started working on a new product. It was born out of my experience building and running WP Pusher.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    That product is <a href="https://www.branchci.com/">Branch</a> - A continuous integration and deployment tool for WordPress. And what's that, you might be asking? It's essentially a tool that can automate the building (npm, composer etc.), testing (coding standards, unit tests etc.) and deployment of your WordPress projects.
</p>
<p>
    Here's a short video tour of the product:

<p>
    <strong>Here are a few key differences between Branch and WP Pusher:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
    <li> - Branch can run your build scripts and tests before deployment, whereas WP Pusher is only a deployment tool.</li>
    <li> - WP Pusher is a WordPress plugin, whereas Branch is a hosted service. That means that you can manage all your sites from within one dashboard instead of going to each site.</li>
    <li> - Branch has recipes for many different tasks, such as deployments with Git or RSync, and integrations with different hosting providers, such as Pantheon and WP Engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>If you want to try out Branch, you can sign up for a free account on <a href="https://www.branchci.com/">branchci.com</a></strong>. With a free account, you can do up to 20 builds/deployments a month.
