Hide or show Elementor widgets based on user role, if logged in or not.

== Description ==
Hide or show an Elementor widget based on whether a user is logged in, logged out (guest) or a specific role.
You can also hide an entire section too or show it just for specific users.

Based on your visibility setting for each widget you can restrict rendering elements on front-end, meaning that you can hide or show any Elementor widget based on the user role(Subscriber, Author, Administrator, etc), if the user is Logged our or if the user is Logged in.

Other restriction options to come. Suggestions are welcomed. 

Here is how you will find the Elementor visibility restrict settings:
1. Open a page with Elementor
2. Go and select any widget from the page
3. Go to Advanced - Visibility control
4. Here you will find the restriction settings for your element.
