== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Who are CarbonClick?=

We’re a small but mighty New Zealand based company, with a vision to make a big impact in the fight against climate change!

We create clever solutions that help people offset the carbon emissions of their purchases. We remove the need for businesses to build their own offsetting programme, by providing everything they need to offer carbon offsets to customers. We power up your climate action.

=What are Carbon offsets?=

Carbon offsets are an effective way to address climate change. When a customer buys a carbon offset it goes towards projects that reduce the carbon in the atmosphere such as funding native forest regeneration or renewable energy.

=What are customers offsetting with their contribution?=

A contribution guarantees they are reducing the environmental impact of their purchase. However, attributing exactly what the offset goes to is hard to pinpoint exactly because of the complex supply chain behind every product. With very high confidence, freight will be offset for most products that use standard courier services for delivery. Furthermore, a meaningful part of the embodied carbon (carbon emissions related to manufacturing the product) will be offset with the remaining amount. If anything is left over after that, then the customer’s contribution is actually making the purchase climate positive – brilliant!

Here are some typical items and the cost to make them carbon neutral:

Plain T-Shirt: $0.30
Trainers: $0.20
Parcel Delivery: $0.05

=Where do the contributions go?=

After we deduct our margin, and payment fee (see below for details), the remainder is then split 50/50. The first half goes to a local project (if available) and the remaining goes to international projects. This idea comes from consumer research where there’s a strong desire to offset with local projects, but because they are expensive we’ve made a compromise and added international offsets to bring the price down & and impact per $ up. We explored the option of consumers selecting their carbon offsetting basket mix, but decided on a simpler option as we cannot distract the user on checkout.

See our projects page for further information about the individual projects. We are always adding more projects – let us know if you have any special requests – we’ll do our best to accommodate them!

=Can you help me with my sustainability program?=

Yes, we can. It’s important to take action on sustainability beyond offsetting and as part of Climate Friendly Cart you get access to a number of resources that are specific to e-commerce.
